README - references

This folder contains a list of papers related to our project, either:
1. introduces algorithms about detecting fake news (we can learn of)
2. a model that we can compare the performance of 
3. could contain a benchmark dataset for us to test
4. etc. 

Specifically, the **Fakeddit Nakamura et al. .pdf** motivates our project idea,
and we are using the dataset provided in this paper. 

Other papers mostly come from an open platform about fake news detection:

A list of benchmarks are also visible from the picture **fake-news-detection_paperlist.png**
